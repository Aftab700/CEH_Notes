# Hacking Mobile Platforms
> Mobile devices allow communication between users on radio frequencies, whether GSM, LTE, 5G, or Wi-Fi. They can be used to send multimedia content, email, and perform many more tasks using the Internet. Mobile security is becoming increasingly challenging with the emergence of complex attacks that use multiple attack vectors to compromise mobile devices. These security threats exploit critical data as well as financial information and other details of mobile users and may also damage the reputation of mobile networks and organizations.
