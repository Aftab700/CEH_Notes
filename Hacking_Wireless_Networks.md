# Hacking Wireless Networks 
> A wireless network is an unbounded data communication system that uses radio-frequency technology to communicate with devices and obtain data. Through radio frequency technology, Wi-Fi allows devices to access wireless networks without cables from anywhere within range of an access point. The wireless network can be at risk to various types of attacks, including access-control attacks, integrity attacks, confidentiality attacks, availability attacks, and authentication attacks.
