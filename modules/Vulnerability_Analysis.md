# Vulnerability Analysis
> Vulnerability assessment is an examination of the ability of a system or application, including current security procedures and controls, to withstand an assault. Vulnerability research is the process of discovering vulnerabilities and design flaws that leave an OS and its applications open to attack or misuse.

A vulnerability refers to a weakness in the design or implementation of a system that can be exploited to compromise the security of the system. It is frequently a security loophole that enables an attacker to enter the system by bypassing user authentication. There are generally two main causes for vulnerable systems in a network, software or hardware misconfiguration and poor programming practices. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to perform various types of attacks on organizational resources.

Vulnerability databases collect and maintain information about various vulnerabilities present in the information systems.

The following are some of the vulnerability scoring systems and databases:

- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
- National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
